# MEMANTO Memory Skill

Detailed reference guide for using MEMANTO persistent memory effectively across sessions.

## Quick Command Reference

All Memanto operations are performed via shell commands. Never simulate commands or keep internal mental notes.

```bash
# Store memory (ALWAYS pass full metadata flags)
memanto remember "Generalized principle or rule" --type TYPE --tags "tag1,tag2" --confidence <0.0-1.0> --provenance PROVENANCE --source claude-code

# Search memories (Semantic recall for context building)
# Reads have no --source, so pass --tool: it is how Memanto knows which agent
# is calling, which drives the live connection view and session attribution.
memanto recall "query string" --limit 10 --type TYPE --min-similarity 0.8 --tool claude-code

# Temporal search variants (no query needed)
memanto recall --recent --limit 10 --tool claude-code            # newest memories first
memanto recall --as-of "YYYY-MM-DD" --tool claude-code           # memory state at a past point in time
memanto recall --changed-since "last 7 days" --tool claude-code  # memories created or updated recently

# Grounded RAG answer (Synthesizes memory into a direct answer)
memanto answer "Question about past decisions or commitments" --tool claude-code

# Edit existing memory
memanto edit MEMORY_ID --content "Updated content" --type TYPE --confidence 0.95

# Delete memory
memanto forget MEMORY_ID

# Sync dynamic memories to local project instructions
memanto memory sync --project-dir .
```

## Memory Types: Complete Decision Matrix

Select the exact memory type that best categorizes the information being persisted. Elevate every memory to a clean, declarative principle—never write chat logs or activity narratives (e.g., "User told me...", "Chose X...", "Agreed to...").

| Type | When to Use | Default Confidence | Default Provenance | Example |
|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| `fact` | Verified technical facts, environment details, project state | 0.9 - 1.0 | `validated` / `observed` | "Database stack is PostgreSQL 15 with Prisma ORM." |
| `decision` | Architecture choices, stack selection, design patterns | 0.9 - 1.0 | `inferred` / `explicit_statement` | "Use Next.js App Router exclusively; Pages Router is deprecated." |
| `instruction` | Standing rules, guidelines, enforced constraints | 0.9 - 1.0 | `explicit_statement` | "Enforce strict TypeScript typing; explicit 'any' is disallowed." |
| `preference` | User style, tooling choices, formatting rules | 0.8 - 1.0 | `explicit_statement` / `observed` | "Use pnpm for dependency management and workspace scripts." |
| `learning` | Workarounds, discovered fixes, post-error insights | 0.8 - 0.95 | `observed` / `corrected` | "Windows build script requires --max-workers=2 to prevent worker process crashes." |
| `goal` | Objectives, roadmap items, target milestones | 0.8 - 1.0 | `explicit_statement` | "Complete OAuth2 authentication workflow integration." |
| `commitment` | Promises, agreed deliverables, explicitly accepted tasks | 1.0 | `explicit_statement` | "Refactor API route handlers before merging PR." |
| `artifact` | Output locations, build targets, file paths | 0.9 - 1.0 | `observed` | "Generated OpenAPI schema lives at ./docs/openapi.json." |
| `event` | Significant milestones, releases, major architectural shifts | 0.8 - 0.95 | `observed` | "Database successfully migrated to v2 schema." |
| `relationship` | Team structure, component ownership, API integrations | 0.85 - 0.95 | `explicit_statement` | "Auth service integrates with Keycloak cluster at auth.example.com." |
| `observation` | Behavioral patterns observed across multiple interactions | 0.6 - 0.85 | `observed` | "Provide concise code blocks without conversational preamble." |
| `error` | Failure post-mortems, bug root causes, regression notes | 0.95 - 1.0 | `observed` / `corrected` | "Parser memory leak was caused by unclosed file handle in logger.py." |
| `context` | Session state summaries, high-level project milestones | 0.9 - 1.0 | `observed` | "Phase 1 backend complete; database models fully migrated." |

## Confidence Levels Guide

Assign a confidence score between `0.0` and `1.0` based on source certainty:

- **1.0** — Explicit user statement, verified codebase fact, standing user instruction.
- **0.9 - 0.95** — Strong technical consensus, verified working code, well-tested pattern.
- **0.8 - 0.85** — Observed pattern (seen 3+ times), indirect user preference with strong evidence.
- **0.7 - 0.75** — Emerging pattern (seen 2 times), reasonable inference from context.
- **0.6 - 0.65** — Single observation, plausible hypothesis needing future confirmation.
- **< 0.6** — **DO NOT STORE.** Too uncertain.

## Provenance Types

Provenance identifies *how* the memory originated. You MUST specify one of the following:

- `explicit_statement` — User directly stated this fact, rule, or preference in conversation.
- `inferred` — Derived logically from user actions, codebase structure, or context.
- `observed` — Witnessed directly during execution, test run, or terminal output.
- `corrected` — Formulated after a previous mistake was corrected by the user or an error.
- `validated` — Verified against code, tests, or official documentation.
- `imported` — Ingested from an external source, config file, or migration.

## Tagging Best Practices

Always pass `--tags` with 2 to 5 specific, lowercase, hyphenated tags. Tags make memories searchable and clusterable.

### Tag Formatting Rules
- **Lowercase & Hyphenated**: Use `bug-fix`, `auth-oauth`, `next-js` (never camelCase or spaces).
- **Be Specific**: Use `prisma-schema` instead of `db`, `jwt-auth` instead of `security`.
- **Include Context & Refs**: Add commit hashes, component names, or issue IDs when relevant (e.g., `commit-a1b2c3d`, `user-router`).

### Good vs Bad Examples
- **GOOD**: `--tags "auth,oauth2,jwt,security"`
- **GOOD**: `--tags "docker,windows,wsl2,networking"`
- **BAD**: `--tags "important,stuff,code"` (Too generic, useless for retrieval)

## Choosing Between `recall` and `answer`

`recall` and `answer` serve distinct, complementary purposes. Choose based on what you need next:

| Criteria | `memanto recall` | `memanto answer` |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Output Type** | Raw memory chunks with IDs, types, and metadata | Synthesized, grounded textual answer |
| **Primary Goal** | Build context for multi-step coding tasks | Answer a direct question or check a decision |
| **When to Use** | Before starting complex work, reviewing options | User asks "What did we decide about X?" |
| **Next Action** | Read memories, extract details, write code | Output answer directly to user or verify a fact |

**Rule of Thumb**:
- Need context to guide your work? Use `memanto recall`.
- Need a synthesized answer to a specific question? Use `memanto answer`.

## Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Activity Logging (The Chat-Log Anti-Pattern)**
   - **BAD**: `memanto remember "User told me to rename button component"`
   - **GOOD**: `memanto remember "UI components must use PascalCase naming convention"`

2. **Memory Hoarding**
   - Ask: *"Will this principle matter to a fresh agent session 3 months from now?"* If no, do not store.

3. **Vague Content**
   - **BAD**: `memanto remember "Improved API speed"`
   - **GOOD**: `memanto remember "API response time must remain under 200ms using Redis caching"`

4. **Missing Metadata Flags**
   - Never omit `--type`, `--confidence`, `--provenance`, or `--source`. Untyped memories pollute retrieval quality.
   - On `recall` and `answer`, always pass `--tool claude-code`. Reads carry no `--source`, and this is how Memanto identifies the calling agent.

5. **Expecting Invisible Context Injection**
   - Do not expect hooks or background tools to automatically inject dynamic memories into chat UI. If context is needed, run `memanto recall` explicitly.

6. **Storing Duplicate Memories**
   - Before storing a major architectural decision or rule, run `memanto recall` to check if a similar rule already exists. Update it with `memanto edit` if necessary.

## Execution Workflows

### Workflow 1: Session Start / Task Initiation
```bash
# Check for existing architectural decisions and instructions relevant to the task
memanto recall "authentication setup guidelines" --limit 10 --tool claude-code
```

### Workflow 2: Learning from Error / Correction
```bash
# Store lesson immediately after fixing a tricky bug or receiving user correction
memanto remember "Next.js standalone build requires output: 'standalone' in next.config.js" --type learning --tags "nextjs,build,deployment" --confidence 1.0 --provenance corrected --source claude-code
```

### Workflow 3: User Sets Architectural Constraint
```bash
# Store user-defined rule immediately
memanto remember "Use UUID v4 for all primary keys across all PostgreSQL tables" --type instruction --tags "database,postgresql,schema" --confidence 1.0 --provenance explicit_statement --source claude-code
```
